Objective: Act as a Senior Technical Product Manager. I need a comprehensive "Technical & Functional Audit" of the TalentOps project in this workspace to prepare for a high-stakes client pitch.

Instructions:

Codebase Deep-Dive: Scan the repository. Identify the core tech stack (Frontend, Backend, Database, Auth). Map out the primary API endpoints and data models.

Product Logic Audit: Analyze the business logic. How does the app handle candidate sourcing, skill mapping, and automation workflows? Be specific about the "secret sauce" in the code.

Validation & Verification: >    * Run the development server.

Use your Browser Agent to navigate the key user flows (e.g., creating a job, viewing talent analytics).

Capture Screenshots and a Browser Recording as artifacts to prove the UI state and functionality.

Gap Analysis: Identify any "missing" enterprise features that a leader from a company like Salesforce (Workday integrations, deep skill matrices, high-scale automation) would expect to see.

Output Required (as Artifacts):

technical_architecture.md: A high-level system diagram and stack breakdown.

product_capabilities.md: A list of current features vs. potential scale-up features.

walkthrough.md: A step-by-step verification of the app's current working state with embedded screenshots.

pitch_ammunition.md: 5 "killer stats" or "technical highlights" found in the code that prove TalentOps is better than manual recruiting
