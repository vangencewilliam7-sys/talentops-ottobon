TALENT OPS - BUSINESS OVERVIEW & STRATEGIC CONTEXT
====================================================

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------
Modern organizations struggle with fragmented workforce management. Key pain points include:
- **Siloed Data:** HR data (leaves, payroll) lives separately from Operational data (tasks, projects), making it impossible to correlate workforce availability with project delivery risks.
- **Manual Compliance:** Payroll processing and compliance checks (e.g., document submission) are manual, error-prone, and reactive, leading to month-end crunches.
- **Subjective Performance:** Employee evaluations are often disconnected from actual daily output, leading to bias and lack of actionable feedback.
- **Communication Gaps:** Corporate chat tools are often noisy and disconnected from the actual work contexts (tasks/projects).

2. VALUE PROPOSITION & ROI
--------------------------
TalentOps integrates HR, Project Management, and Payroll into a single "Operating System" for talent.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- **30% Reduction in Admin Overhead:** unique "Payroll Health Widgets" and automated compliance tracking reduce manual HR chases.
- **Real-Time Delivery Risk Mitigation:** correlates Leave data with Project timelines to predict bottlenecks.
- **Fairer Performance Reviews:** Links "Skills Assessments" directly to "Task Completion" data.
- **Zero-Cost Compliance:** Proactive alerts prevent payroll processing errors before they happen.
