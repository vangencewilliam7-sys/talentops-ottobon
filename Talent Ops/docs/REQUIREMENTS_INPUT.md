Please paste your detailed requirements or information here.
Once you have pasted the information, save the file and let me know so I can process it, divide it into chunks, and create an implementation plan.

here is the info :

see now act like a app developer, implement secon order thinking and then first principles so now i want you to understand this part and then divide them into chunks ok so that step by step i will provide that chunk to antigravity to so that implement step by step without any hallucinatiosn and confusion ok and also see those steps has to be interlinked and has to be have aconnection to the next step ok like a step wise continuiton ok. now here is thet text info :

 TASK MODULE :

So in my tasks module there are 5 phases and then there are steps where each step is for 2 hours/4 hours based on what the person who is assigning the task is selected, and now there are points allocated to each tasks, and then there is also a percentile it has to be calculated by considering out of all the employee’s and his points out of . now it has to show a percentile of that person for a week and for a month out of 100. Now while assigning a task the project manager has to add steps and each step is 2 hours or 4 hours based on selected , now based on total steps for a task the points per hour are 10 and it has to show his total points earned on out of his whole tasks points and it has to be shown [ lets just say there is a person and then he has 2 tasks in total , now there is 1st task and that task is total of 100 points and he earned 60 points and then there is 2nd task where the total points for that task is 120 and he earned 100 points, so now his total points earned on his whole tasks are 160 out of 220 points ok….. and then the percentile part see it has to calculate by considering all the employee’s ok like see it has to show in his own project and also by whole organisation ok………… 

NOW LET’S TALK ABOUT MY TASK FLOW OK:
•	First of all, any higher authority can assign task to anyone like any org manager, executive can assign task to anyone across the company in any project ok….
•	But a proj manager can assign task to his own team mates only ok..
•	Now the task flow goes like this -> first the project manager or org manager or executive will create a title with description and then he will keep a skill tag and then it will filter the members like based on his review score in his technical assignment, like If I kept a skill tag called frontend, it then filters the employee’s of that project form least to highest like who has the least score in frontend it has to show him on the top and then the highest on the bottom like ascending to descending order and then he can select individual , entire team or multiple members
•	Now he has to select the start date and start time and the phases of that task and then in phases of that task he will add steps [ means if the assigned person completed the steps of that phase that means he has completed that particular phase ] and each step is 2 hours or 4 hours, the assigner can select the hours for each step[ 2hrs or 4hrs for all steps, if he selected 2 hours then that means all the steps are 2 hrs only]  and the total allocated hours for that task is calculated based on all the steps that are present [ like lets just say if he has total of 5 steps then that means he has total of 10 hours if each step is 2 hours and 20 hours if each step is 4 hours.
•	Now based on his hours the total points have to get calculated ok. Like 5 steps , each step is 2 hrs total is 10 hours 10 points per hour, then total of 100 points ok and decrement points will be added by the any of the higher authority and then if eh assign a task then that employee starts working on that task so now if he completes before the allocated hours then the left over hour points will be added as increment for his total points[see if he is submitted  his task on the last hour  or he won’t get awarded any increment points]   and then he get rewarded those points and then if he submitted after the time then for his total time the
time passed that time’s points/decrement points will be deducted from his total points and those points will be deducted form his total points will be awarded for him 
and at the same time it has to calculate the percentile weekly and montly for it has to show in whole org and the same time within his team too…..ok
